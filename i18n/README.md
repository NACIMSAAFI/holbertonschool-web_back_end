## Description

This project implements internationalization (i18n) in a Flask web application. It demonstrates how to parametrize templates for multiple languages, infer user locale, and localize timestamps using Flask-Babel.

## Learning Objectives

* Learn how to parametrize Flask templates to display different languages.
* Learn how to infer the correct locale based on URL parameters, user settings, or request headers.
* Learn how to localize timestamps.

## Requirements

* All files must be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **Python 3.9**.
* Each file should end with a new line.
* A **README.md** file is mandatory at the root of the project folder.
* Code should adhere to **pycodestyle** style (version 2.5).
* The first line of all Python files must be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
* All Python files should be executable.
* All modules, classes, functions, and methods must have documentation.

## Documentation Guidelines

* Every module should contain a docstring explaining its purpose.
* Classes should have a docstring describing their functionality.
* Each function and method should have a docstring with a clear explanation of its purpose.
* All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.

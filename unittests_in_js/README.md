# Hey there! 👋 Welcome to My Web Stack Programming Project

This is part of my journey through the **[C#22] Spe - Web Stack Programming 2024** curriculum, guided by Johann Kerbrat, who's an Engineering Manager at Uber Works. I’ve been working hard on this project, and it’s all about diving deep into **unit testing and integration testing** with JavaScript.

## 🚀 What’s This Project About?

In a nutshell, I’m building a suite of tests using **Mocha**, **Chai**, and **Sinon** to make sure everything runs smoothly. You know, testing is like that unsung hero in the development world — not flashy, but super important. This project is my attempt to master testing so that I can ensure my Node.js apps are rock solid. 💪

### My Progress So Far

- I’m working on the **master branch**, so all the latest and greatest updates are right here.
- The focus is on **writing unit tests** that cover every corner of my code, and I’ve even included some **integration tests** with a mini Node server.

## 🛠️ Tools I’m Using

Here are the main tools and libraries I’ve been experimenting with:

- **Mocha**: My main testing framework. It’s super flexible and works great for writing all kinds of tests.
- **Chai**: This is my assertion library. It helps me write readable and maintainable test cases.
- **Sinon**: I use this for spies, stubs, and mocks. It’s perfect for testing functions and controlling the behavior of my code.
- **Express**: I’ve set up a small server with Express for integration testing. It’s lightweight and easy to use.

## 📝 What I’ve Learned So Far

This project has been a fantastic learning experience! Here’s what I’ve got under my belt now:

- Writing **test suites** with Mocha that are clear and well-structured.
- Using **Chai** for all kinds of assertions (and making sure they’re easy to read).
- Creating **spies** and **stubs** with Sinon to test specific parts of my code without side effects.
- Utilizing **hooks** like `beforeEach` and `afterEach` to streamline my test setup.
- Handling **async functions** in my tests without losing my mind. 😅
- Building **integration tests** to make sure my Node server plays well with my API endpoints.

# üìä Queuing System in JS

Welcome to the **Queuing System in JS** project! This project is part of my journey in [C#22] Specialization - Web Stack Programming 2024 at Holberton School.

## üìù Introduction

In this project, I dive into **Redis**, a powerful in-memory data store, and **Kue**, a job queue system. The goal is to build an **Express app** that interacts with Redis and manages background tasks using Kue. By the end of this project, I will have created a scalable queuing system using these tools.

## üß† Key Learning Objectives

After completing this project, I can now explain:

- How to run a Redis server on your machine.
- How to perform basic Redis operations using the Redis client.
- How to use a Redis client with Node.js.
- How to store and manage hash values in Redis.
- How to handle asynchronous operations in Redis.
- How to use **Kue** as a queue system.
- How to build a basic **Express** app interacting with Redis.
- How to build a basic Express app interacting with both Redis and Kue.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

The following technologies and tools were used to build this project:

- **Node.js** (v12.x)
- **Redis** (v5.0.7)
- **Express** (v4.17.1)
- **Kue** (v0.11.6)
- **Babel** for JavaScript transpilation
- **Mocha & Chai** for testing
- **ESLint** for code linting
